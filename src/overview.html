<P>The Rapt library is a compendium of very small tools sharing a
common theme of the apt tool new in J2SE 5.0. 
</P>
<P>Tools in the Rapt libray have the following lifecycle. 
</P>
<DL>
	<DT>Experimental 
	</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	These tools are experimental, they are being evaluated to see
	firstly if something is possible, and secondly whether it is
	feasible. 
	</DD><DD>
	Experimental tools are not shipped in the binary download, and are
	only available in source code form. (We might change our minds about
	that and ship a separate experimental binary. Experimental tools are
	volatile, and no reliance on them should be made in production code.
		</DD><DT>
	Proposed 
	</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	Proposed tools have their utility accepted (that is, we think they
	are useful), and are close to their final form. We really like
	feedback on proposed tools, and the javadocs should contain a link
	to a discussion forum where you can comment on them. In some cases
	we may have some undecided features, we will list these in the
	javadoc, and we would like to know your views. 
	</DD><DD>
	If we change the functionality of a proposed tool, we will make sure
	it is backward compatible, so your existing code will still work. We
	will also leave the proposed version as is when we release the
	version we are happy with. If necessary we will achieve this by
	issuing a Mark II proposed version in a different package from the
	newest version that is compatible with the original proposed
	version. IF we ever do this, we will decide what the package is
	called and let you know. 
	</DD><DT>
	Released 
	</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	Released tools are stable and functionally complete in our opinion. 
	</DD></DL>

<DL>
	<DT>Generators</DT><DD>
	These are annotations and associated processors which work by
	automatically generating additional source code (when you source is
	compiled with apt instead of javac).

	Mirror tools</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	These are utility classes helpful to those writing their own

<H2>Using Generators</H2>
<P>Each generator annotation will contain details of what it does and
how to use its API description. 
</P>
<P>Once you have written some code which uses a generator you need to
do the following. 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Compile your code with J2SE 5.0
	(or later) &quot;apt&quot; tool rather than javac. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Pass apt all the options you would
	normally pass to javac to build your code. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Always specify a directory to
	place the generated source code in using apt's -s option. (if you
	don't it generates it in the same directory as the source, which
	works the first time, but the next time you compile *.java, it
	compiles the generated source on the first round, then when it
	compiles the newly generated source in the second round, there is a
	duplicate class error.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Always specify a destination
	directory with -d, (even if you dont with javac) otherwise the
	generated source's class files will be placed in the -s directory,
	rather than to the same place as your other class files. If the
	destination is the current directory use -d . 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">make sure rapt.jar is on your
	classpath.

	<LI><P>do NOT use apt's -factory option, it will find the annotation
	Processors automatically. 
	</P>
</OL>
<P>Once you have compiled (successfully) with apt, the generator
should work as documented. You may view the generated source code if
you are interested, it will be under the directory specified by the
-s option.</P>

<P>Unless stated, in the Annotation Type API, rapt's processors do
