/**
Generators that are ready for widespread use and evaluation, but may not be
quite in their final release forms.

We will do our best to make sure that changes to proposed classes are backward
compatible, and code written against earlier versions will still function the same.
But we may add additional functionality with default values that operate the same as the
earlier version.
<p>
Generators are annotations which cause the generation of additional classes to support their purpose
when the code using those annotations is compiled with the apt tools (as opposed to the javac tool).
