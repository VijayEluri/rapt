Fork of Bruce Chapman's rapt library which is using annotation processors to provide language features

language features provided
==========================

* SAM generation
* Multiline Strings
* Pair and Tandem

this library had many different versions, so stuff lived in cvs some in svn, it was extremely hard to manage.

The version attached to the 'No Closure' "article":http://weblogs.java.net/blog/brucechapman/archive/2008/03/anouncement_no.html was not working with eclipse 3.5, so I ended up retrofitting changes back to the original version and the result is this library.

what works
=========
* generate SAM type for methods marked with @net.java.dev.rapt.sam.As
* allow passing parameters by marking parameters with @net.java.dev.rapt.sam.As
* generate multi-line strings with net.java.dev.generator.LongString 
* provide net.java.dev.util.In, net.java.dev.util.Pair and net.java.dev.util.Tandem
